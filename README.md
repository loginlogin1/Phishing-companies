## [](#table-of-contents) Фишинговые компании

Снизу представлены разборы/отчёты об фишинговых компаниях APT группировок, которые содержат пример писем, с помощью которого осуществлялась рассылка. Зачастую разборы атак APT группировок не содержат примеры писем, это побудило меня создать репозиторий в котором будут отчёты/разборы, которые точно содержат фишинговое письмо. Постепенно данный список будет пополняться. Contributing приветствуется.
## [](#talbe-ofcontets) Phishing companies
Below are analysis/reports on APT grouping phishing campaigns that contain a phishing email. In most cases, APT group attack reports do not contain examples of emails, this prompted me to create a repository in which there will be analysis/reports that will definitely contain a phishing email. Gradually, this list will be replenished. Contributing is welcome
